# ID Jumper for 4chan
Got caught by the latest LARP thread?

Do you want to follow all the OP posts yet you are too lazy to hit `Ctrl+F`?

Don't worry, we got you covered!

This script allows you to jump to the next post from the same ID in /pol/, /biz/ and /bant/ threads. It will put a little **Rewind** `⏪` and **Fast-Forward** `⏩` button near the poster ID.

Just **click** to jump to the previous or the next post!
