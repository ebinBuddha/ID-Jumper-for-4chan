# ID Jumper for 4chan
Got caught by the latest LARP thread?
Do you want to follow all the OP posts yet you are too lazy to hit `Ctrl+F`?
Don't worry, we got you covered!
This script allows you to jump to the next post from the same ID in /pol/ and /bant/ threads. It will put a little **Fast-Forward** `⏩` button near the poster ID.
Just **click it** to jump to the next post!
